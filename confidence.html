    <p>MY JOURNEY TO CONFIDENCE</p>
       <p>
       I did not know that i was scared of speaking infront of a lot of people. I could talk to a number of people who were close to me because i am comfortable talking to them. When it comes to speaking infront of people I become so nervous that I forget what I am supposed to say I used to avoid speaking alot and even hide when I am called. I had lots of good ideas but because of the fear I was not able to say them to people because I feared sounding stupid This has caused me alot because of myself doubt I've gotthen into trouble because of not participating in class and answering questions yet I knew the answer or an idea to what is being asked. I realised that I just have to speak because thats the only way. I talked to my friend and she advised me to always speak on the mirror to gain my confidence. I began speaking to the mirror for some time then I could pick a few people who are not my friends then I speak infront of them and present my work and what I hve done.
      The pictures below shows my journey from self doubt to gaining confidence and be where I am.
