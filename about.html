        Viktor Frankl who was a prisoner at Nazi concentration camp where he experienced torture but this did not stop him from imagining life after prison where he would be able to meet with the wife. Due to her positivity he was able to undergo all that torture and survived the prison life.
        In our current situation where this pandemic has affected the whole world many people are not seeing life after this pandemic but their minds are stuck to this pandemic. We should be able to see life after this pandemic where our lives will go back to normal and everything back in place.

        Gender based violence
       Trevorâ€™s mum was beaten by Abel several times and the last fight he shot her and nearly killed her. This is shown that women don't have  their own power and they should respect their husband and do what they tell them because when trevors mum went to report to the police nothing was done because the police were abels pals and he used to fix their cars so no charges were filed against him.
      In our current world of today we still see that women are still beaten by their husbands and nothing is done but the few women who see beyond have been able to stand on their own and fight against gender based violence.<br>

      <p>Racism
      The black were separated from the white where the whites lived in rich places while the blacks lived in poor places and they were not allowed to interact. Students in school were also separated where blacks stay in one place and the white in different places. The churches were also separated where the whites had their own church while the blacks had their own church.
      Our current life still displays racism where the whites still dont want to interact with the poor and also the rich don't want to associate with the poor they even don't want to help them out and yet they have more than enough.<br>

     <p>Volunteer to join organizations that help in preventing corona virus.
     So many organizations out here are teaching people on how to keep safe from this pandemic because it's easily spread.the youth can help these organizations by teaching young children and the elderly on how to keep safe to wear a mask all the time and always wash their hands and carry a sanitizer wherever they go and keep social distance doing this can help flatten the curve.
     reading something new
    Most of the youths now are idle and they don't have anything to do. They can find books or novels to read or even read very nice articles from the internet.
    exercise
    This helps to keep you fit and keep you healthy and also takes your mind off from too much thinkinking and stress.
    Learn to explore and try out new things
    This will keep their minds busy where they will not be able to be idle. They can watch tutorials on youtube like cooking a new recipe and try it out. They can also learn how to knit or crochet and try it out.
    cleaning
    The youth can engage themselves in cleaning like they can form groups and decide to sweep roads or go to the elderly and help them with cleaning.they can also clean near dumpsites to reduce dangers of children getting sick.<br></p>
<p>Two that are progressive.
       Christianity 
         The introduction to christianity brought about more religious mission opportunities. Most missionaries introduced education in africa by establishing mission schools to educate local people and learn more about christianity. This has helped african countries develop into christianity and believe in the existence of God which has made them to forget their cultures and traditions and worship God.

     New technology
    This has really made a big impact in the african countries where they were taught new things. They were brought farm tools from the new world and were taught how to use them. Jobs were created which made the Africans learn how to trade with the europeans. Better institutions were established to govern people which has helped most african countries.
   Two that are not progressive.
    Social media  
    This has affected the youth where they get peer pressure to do their own things which are not pleasing like pornography and playing video games which makes them to steal money from their own parents.


       Mode of dressing
       The moral values taught back in the days are not taught right now where the youth are not having manners and their mode of dressing is not pleasing.<br>
